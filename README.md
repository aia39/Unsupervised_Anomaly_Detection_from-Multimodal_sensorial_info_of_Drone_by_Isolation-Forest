# Anomaly_Detection-by-Isolation-Forest
Unsupervised anomaly detection is now a days very vital thing in digital world.Anomaly always expected to happen rarely so unsupervised approach is necessary to deal with it.Isolation forest is one of the renowned method to detect anomaly unsupervised manner.Various use of isolation forest is showed in the repository.
